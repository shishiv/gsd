# Decision Frameworks

| Situation | Framework |
|-----------|-----------|
| Challenge assumptions | First Principles |
| Find root cause | 5 Whys |
| Prioritize tasks | Eisenhower Matrix |
| Focus effort | Pareto 80/20 |
| Identify risks | Inversion |
| Map consequences | Second-Order Thinking |
| Compare options | Decision Matrix |

## Processes

**First Principles:** State problem → list assumptions → challenge each → identify fundamentals → build from truths.

**5 Whys:** State problem → ask "why?" iteratively → verify chain backwards → act on deepest cause.

**Eisenhower:** Urgent+Important (do), Not-Urgent+Important (schedule), Urgent+Not-Important (delegate), Neither (eliminate).

**Pareto:** List items → measure impact → sort → find ~20% driving ~80% → focus there.

**Inversion:** State goal → "what guarantees failure?" → list failure modes → invert into prevention.

**Second-Order:** Map effects → map what THOSE cause → find hidden costs → decide with full picture.

**Decision Matrix:** List options → weighted criteria → score each → sum → sanity check winner.

# Blanket rule: all text files use LF line endings in both the Git index
# and the working directory on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
# IMPORTANT: eol=lf forces LF checkout on Windows — "text=auto" alone
# would check out CRLF on Windows, which breaks YAML, shell scripts, etc.
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicit overrides for file types that are sensitive to CRLF corruption.
# Belt-and-suspenders: these rules repeat the blanket intent for clarity
# and to survive any future blanket-rule edits.
*.yml  text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf
*.json text eol=lf
*.sh   text eol=lf
*.snap text eol=lf

# Binary files: skip line-ending translation entirely to prevent corruption.
